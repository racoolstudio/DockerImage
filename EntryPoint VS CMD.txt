
ENTRYPOINT VS CMD IN DOCKER

CMD runs binaries command, also takes arguments 

FROM ubuntu:lastest
CMD [“echo”,”Hello world”]

This would give us Hello World when ran

ENTRY POINT runs commands too but user can pass in argument to the docker file when you use the docker run 

FROM ubuntu:lastest
ENTRYPOINT [“echo”]

So when you use docker run you would say docker run imagename Hello Racool
The output would be “Hello Racool”

Now the combination of CMD and ENTRYPOINT 

ENTRYPOINT can act as the command that receives input from users using the docker run imagename … args while CMD acts as a default argument if no argument is passed from the docker run command

FROM ubuntu:latest
ENTRYPOINT [“echo”]
CMD [“Hello”]

When you say docker run … imagename : you will get “Hello” but if you ran
docker run … imagename Hello World : you will get Hello Wolrd as it overrides the CMD default command or argument
